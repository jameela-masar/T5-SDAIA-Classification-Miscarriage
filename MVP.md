There are many pregnant women who suddenly miscarry, which affects their psychological state,
so we will build a model capable of predicting the continuation of pregnancy or not.
The sooner a miscarriage occurs in the first weeks of pregnancy, the easier and safer it will be.

By measuring the correlation between the features and the target variable and understanding the relationships between them, it was found that the most significant factor affecting the continuation of the pregnancy or not is the age of the woman. As the age of the woman increases, the greater the probability of miscarriage.
But this does not mean that other features should be ignored, because they all have an effect on miscarriage.

Through the illustrated graph, it measures several factors: the feature, which has a significant impact on the target variable, and the gini, which is one of the most important factors if it is close to zero, it means that these data belong to the same class, the samples, which represent the number of data we want to divide, and the class represents the two values 0 and 1, where 0 represents no miscarriage and 1 represents miscarriage.
